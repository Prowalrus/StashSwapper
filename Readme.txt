This program will copy across your stash and current gear from your pre-3.9.0 PMC to one setup post-3.9.0
In order for this to work, you must have fully loaded on the new PMC at least once (all the way to the Menu)

Make sure it's in the root SPT folder (e.g. <drive>/SPT)
Using PROFILE (not character) names, choose the old profile name followed by the new profile name.
It should run fine.
